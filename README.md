# Dijkstra's Algorithm 
An implementation of Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm. 
Consists of a map of cities where users have the option to add/remove cities.

The algorithm allows users to find the shortest path between two locations.
     The shortest path can either be shortest distance or lowest cost.

The program is a simple console program. 
The network of cities are held in a text file in the root directory. Example text documents can be seen in the repository.
