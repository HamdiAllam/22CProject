# 22CProject
Data Structure and Algorithm school course 

Final project consisted of an implementation of Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm. 
We chose to create a map of cities where users have the option to add/remove cities.
The algorithm allows users to find the shortest path between two locations.
     The shortest path can either be shortest distance or lowest cost.


The program is a simple console program. 
The network of cities are held in a text file in the root directory. Example text documents can be seen in the repository.
